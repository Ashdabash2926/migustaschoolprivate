# Me Gusta Redesign — Session Review
**Date:** 31 March 2026

---

## What Was Done

### 1. cafe.html — Built from scratch
Created the full Café page for Me Gusta Spanish, covering:
- **Hero** — dark coffee-brown background with two floating polaroid photos and an animated SVG steam effect. Terra-coloured ticker strip with scrolling copy.
- **The Space** — atmospheric section with an overlapping dual-polaroid layout (main interior shot + smaller courtyard photo overlapping bottom-right), and clean left-rule feature items (Colonial Architecture, Free WiFi, Open-Air Courtyard) using `border-left: 2px solid var(--terra)` — no box backgrounds or icons.
- **Menu** — four categories (Coffee, Food, Cold Drinks, Special Drinks) with hover left-bar effect and ghost `"café"` background text.
- **Coffee Origins** — dark section highlighting three Bolivian single-origin coffees (Caranavi, Yungas, Lavazza blend) with gold-accent hover cards.
- **Reviews** — three customer testimonials in polaroid-style cards.
- **Visit Info** — address (Bolivar #603), opening hours, and study space callout.
- Full EN/ES language toggle support (`data-en` / `data-es` attributes).
- Scroll reveal via IntersectionObserver.
- Matches the font stack and CSS variables used across the rest of the redesign (Cormorant, Caveat, Lora).

### 2. Café nav link — size bump across all pages
Increased the Café link font-size in the nav from `1.55rem` (previously bumped from `1.25rem`) across all 10 HTML files:
`index.html`, `classes.html`, `methodology.html`, `teachers.html`, `cafe.html`, `about.html`, `accommodation.html`, `faqs.html`, `blog.html`, `contact.html`

### 3. cafe.html — Design iteration
Applied the frontend-design skill to produce a heavily redesigned version of cafe.html with a more editorial aesthetic. After review, reverted to the original version as the base, keeping two specific elements from the redesign:
- **Overlapping dual-polaroid** in the atmosphere section (replacing the original three-photo grid)
- **Left-rule feature items** (replacing rounded card components that felt too generic)

### 4. Folder structure
Moved all 10 HTML files from `megusta-redesign/` into a clean project folder at:
```
/Users/ash/Projects/migusta/
```
No code changes required — all inter-page links use relative filenames and continue to work correctly.

## Session — 31 March 2026 (continued)

### 5. cafe.html — Coffee Origins section redesign
Replaced the three equal rounded cards (AI-looking) with an editorial **archive/logbook** layout:
- Three horizontal rows separated by thin gold ruled lines (`1px solid rgba(196,145,58,0.18)`)
- Large faded index numbers (`01`, `02`, `03`) in ghosted Cormorant (4.5rem, opacity ~13%) as left column
- Origin name in large Cormorant (left-aligned), location label in Caveat above
- Description text in Lora italic, left-aligned, not boxed
- Taste notes stacked on the right as italic Cormorant text with thin underline strokes
- Removed: flag emojis, rounded cards, gold top borders, pill taste tags
- Fully bilingual (`data-en`/`data-es`) preserved throughout
- CSS classes renamed: `origins-grid` → `origins-list`, `origin-card` → `origin-entry`, `taste-tag` → `taste-note`

### 6. Git setup & GitHub push
- Initialised git repo in `/Users/ash/Projects/migusta/`
- Created and pushed to `github.com/Ashdabash2926/migusta` (public)
- Initial commit included all 10 HTML files
- **Repo later renamed to `migustaschoolprivate` and set to private** (April 2026)
- Remote URL updated to: `https://github.com/Ashdabash2926/migustaschoolprivate.git`

### 7. Added migusta to Studio North portfolio
- Took Puppeteer screenshot of local `index.html` at 1440×900
- Converted to WebP (69KB) via Sharp
- Added portfolio card to `studio-north/index.html` as card 9 (before Peak Form)
- Card links to `ashdabash2926.github.io/migusta/` — GitHub Pages needs enabling to go live
- Pushed to `github.com/Ashdabash2926/studio-north`

### 8. Navbar logo — image replacing text
- Added `images/megustalogoclear.png` to navbar across all 10 pages
- Replaced `.nav-logo` text (`Me Gusta Spanish`) with `<img class="nav-logo-img">`
- Nav height set to explicit `64px`, vertical padding removed, logo fills full height via `height: 100%`
- `classes.html` had a multiline `#main-nav` block — fixed separately after sed missed it
- Logo switched from `megustalogo.png` to `megustalogoclear.png` across all pages

## Session — 8 April 2026

### 9. French language option — added then reverted
- Python script added FR as a third language option (flag dropdown replacing EN/ES buttons) across all 10 pages
- Script had two bugs: (1) orphaned `@keyframes` CSS left invalid fragments; (2) HTML regex consumed `nav-cta` and `nav-burger` elements plus the nav-right closing `</div>`, leaving all pages broken
- All attempted fixes in that session failed to commit
- **Decision: reverted all 10 pages to `f35ab6f`** (pre-French EN/ES toggle state)

### 10. cafe.html — nav and section recovery
- `cafe.html` had its real photo redesign (DSC images, carousel, atmosphere section) only in the working directory — never committed separately before the French script ran
- The committed version (`927e334`) had the FR dropdown nav and was missing the hero + atmosphere HTML sections (lost to the Python script)
- Recovery process:
  - Restored `927e334` cafe.html (had DSC photo content + carousel)
  - Replaced FR dropdown nav with EN/ES lang-bubble toggle (CSS + HTML + JS)
  - Fixed two broken `@keyframes` rules (`floatIn` and `tickMove`)
  - Rebuilt missing hero section: DSC06122 background, DSC06175 polaroid card, ticker strip
  - Rebuilt missing atmosphere section: DSC05948 full-bleed left, DSC06100 inset polaroid, left-rule features
  - Added missing `<div id="navMobile">` — its absence caused a JS error that prevented IntersectionObserver from running, making all `.reveal` sections invisible

### 11. Images committed to GitHub
- `images/cafe/` (all `.webp`) and `images/school/` (`.jpg` — not yet used in HTML) added to git and pushed
- Stray `DSC06100 copy 2.tiff` deleted from cafe folder
- GitHub Pages enabled on `migustaschoolprivate` repo (now public)
- Live site: `https://ashdabash2926.github.io/migustaschoolprivate`

### Notes
- `images/school/` contains `.jpg` files — must convert to `.webp` before using in any HTML page
- The nav Python scripts (`fix_nav.py`, `fix_nav2.py`) are still in the project root — can be deleted

## Session — 17 April 2026

### 25. Hero animations — index.html
Added four animations to the hero section on `index.html`, all changes inline in the single file.

- **Ken Burns background** — slow pan/zoom on a new `.hero::before` pseudo-element (28s loop desktop, 40s mobile, alternating). Inline `style="background-image: ..."` on `<section class="hero">` removed in favour of the pseudo-element so parallax can target it without fighting Ken Burns.
- **Polaroid drop-in** — `.hero-right` animation swapped from `fadeUp` to a new `polaroidDrop` keyframe. Drops from `translateY(-120%) rotate(-12deg)` to `translateY(0) rotate(0deg)` with `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` for a small overshoot. The child `.polaroid`'s own `rotate(2.5deg)` shows through as the resting tilt.
- **Hand-drawn underline** — inline SVG (`<svg class="hero-underline">`) added as a sibling of the `<span>` inside the `<em>` in the hero title. Wavy path drawn via `stroke-dasharray`/`stroke-dashoffset` animation, 0.9s ease-out, 1.4s delay (lands after the title fade-up). `.hero-title em` augmented with `position: relative; display: inline-block` so the absolute SVG anchors to each language's width.
- **Scroll parallax** — new IIFE in the existing `<script>` block with rAF-throttled scroll handler. Sets `--parallax-y` on `.hero` (consumed by `.hero::before` via `transform: translate3d`) and `--parallax-rot` on `.polaroid` (consumed via the independent CSS `rotate:` property). IntersectionObserver pauses when hero is offscreen. Self-disables on `matchMedia('(max-width: 960px)')` and `matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')`.

### 26. Accessibility + mobile handling
- New `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block: Ken Burns off, polaroid entrance reverts to gentle `fadeUp`, underline snaps in instantly, ticker marquee stops (`.ticker-track { animation: none }`).
- New rule inside `@media (max-width: 960px)`: `.hero::before { animation-duration: 40s }` slows Ken Burns on mobile.
- Parallax JS self-gates on both conditions (already in step 25).

### 27. Review findings applied
- Polaroid scroll rotation was smearing because `.polaroid`'s existing `transition: transform 0.4s ease` (for hover) was also transitioning the scroll-driven rotation. Moved scroll rotation to the independent CSS `rotate:` property so the `transform` transition no longer dampens parallax updates.
- Trimmed `will-change` on `.hero::before` from `transform, background-position, background-size` to just `transform` — the non-composited properties don't benefit from the hint.

### 28. Spec + plan committed
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-17-hero-animations-design.md` — design spec
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-17-hero-animations.md` — task-by-task implementation plan

All 10 hero commits pushed to `origin/main` → live on `ashdabash2926.github.io/migustaschoolprivate`.

## Rules & Conventions

### Image Workflow
- If a JPG/PNG is already exported at a reasonable size (under ~200KB, resized to ~800px long edge, sRGB colour space), it can be used directly — no conversion needed
- For large/unoptimised images, convert to `.webp` using `cwebp -q 82 -resize 800 0`
- After converting, delete the original — no duplicates allowed
- Only one format per image should remain in the `images/` folder
- Reason: keeps the images folder clean and reduces file sizes loaded by the site
